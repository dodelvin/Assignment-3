First, we write "cmd" to our file in file explorer in order to execute our code. After that, Visual Studio Code, which contains our source code, will launch automatically, like our jsx, css, etc. 
Next, once it opened there, we had to type "npm install" into the "node" terminal, which is the first terminal.Therefore, installing packages to nodemodules is shown by "npm install." Next, we write "npm run dev," which instructs the program to be used. 
Next, we're going to write "json-server –watch db.json" in the second terminal. It also means using the JSON server.  After, that with the help of link, you can enter the website. So, in home page, in first page you can find some projects, assignments, that I have done. You can visit them, check out to see what I have done. Then, there is the second page, that navigates to FlashCards. 
There is flashcards, and you can edit or you can create a new flashcard. It can help you in your project, and also in studying. And lastly, there is a Contact Me page.  You can write your name, e-mail, phone number, etc. and you can submit all of them, that we can contact.
